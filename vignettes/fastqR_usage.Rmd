```{r setup}
library(fastqR)
```

This is a short document to demonstrate the usage of the ```fastqR``` package.  The main functions of the package are laid out below:

Parsing FastQ files
===================

You can parse a fastq file as shown below:

```{r}
read_fastq(system.file("good.fq", package = "fastqR")) -> fastq_data

fastq_data
```

You can also manually do a calculation of GC content

```{r}
gc_content(c("GATCGCGATGCTATGCGTATGCG","TAGTATTGCTATTATATGATTA"))
```


Decoding of encoded Phred scores
================================

The quality scores in a fastq file are encoded Phred scores.  We have a function which can decode them.

```{r}
decode_qualities(fastq_data$Qualities[1])
```
